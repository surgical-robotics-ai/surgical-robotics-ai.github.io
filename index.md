# [Surgical Robotics AI](https://github.com/surgical-robotics-ai)

Our mission is to advance the application of machine learning in robotic surgery.
Our primary application domain is the telesurgical approach exemplified in operating rooms
by the da Vinci surgical system and in research labs by the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK)
and Raven II open platforms.
