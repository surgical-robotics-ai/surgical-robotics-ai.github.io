# [ISMR 2024](http://www.ismr.gatech.edu/) Workshop: Machine Learning with the da Vinci Research Kit

**Workshop Date:**  June 3, 2024 (half-day)

**Venue:** Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA USA

**Location:** TBD

## Objectives

The objective of this workshop is to advance the application of machine learning in robotic surgery. The primary application domain is the telesurgical approach exemplified in operating rooms by the da Vinci surgical system and in research labs by the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) and Raven II open platforms.

This workshop will consist of invited research presentations and include live demonstrations. The primary focus will be on machine learning with the dVRK or Raven II, but relevant research performed with other platforms is welcome.  All presentations will be in-person.
